My name is Jeremiah. I am working towards an Associates in Homeland Security. I chose homeland security because it seemed interesting and has a lot of opportunities Growing up I been all over the country because my dad is in the military.
I see technical writing as writing that is needed for multiple writings through school, work, and more.
